# Probability-of-False-Alarm-vs-Probability-of-Detection-in-Cognitive-Radio-Network
- Probability of False Alarm vs Probability of Detection of Primary User in CRN using different channel like Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami channel.
- Probability of Detection Pd defines the probability of correctly detecting the presence of the
primary users in the spectrum. Probability of False Alarm Pf defines the probability of declaring
the presence of the primary user by mistake.
probability of miss detection is (1-p_d) where p_d is probability of detection .
probability of miss detection is when primary user is present but we think its not.
Total error rate of any spectrum sensing model is given by probability of false alaram p_f + probabilty of miss detection p_m
- Here We have used Monte Carlo simulation
