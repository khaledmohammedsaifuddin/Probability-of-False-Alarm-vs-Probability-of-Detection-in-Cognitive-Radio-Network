# Probability-of-False-Alarm-vs-Probability-of-Detection-in-Cognitive-Radio-Network
- Probability of False Alarm vs Probability of Detection of Primary User in CRN using different channel like Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami channel.
- Probability of Detection Pd defines the probability of correctly detecting the presence of the
primary users in the spectrum. Probability of False Alarm Pf defines the probability of declaring
the presence of the primary user by mistake.
- Here We have used Monte Carlo simulation
